**GAME IDEA - IDK yet**
**Game Genre**: 2D Precision Platformer 
**Description**: Platformer where you play the same level, getting harder each loop. There will be 5 loops per level.
**Features**: 
- Tight platforming (wall jumps, coyote time, jump buffering, etc)
- Loop-based levels getting harder each iteration
- Each level will introduce unique gimmicks
- Potentially a speedrun timer
**Gameplay**: There will be 3-5 levels overall. Each level is short but it loops when you beat it. Use precise platforming to break out of the loop.
**Game Engine**: Godot 4.4 
**Experience**: 7 game jams using Unity and Godot
**Other Notes**: This is for the GMTK 2025 game jam with the theme "loop". Probably gonna do 16x16 pixel art.
