## Initial post
**GAME IDEA - IDK yet**

**Game Genre**: 2D Precision Platformer 

**Description**: Platformer where you play the same level, getting harder each loop. There will be 5 loops per level.

**Features**: 
- Tight platforming (wall jumps, coyote time, jump buffering, etc)
- Loop-based levels getting harder each iteration
- Each level will introduce unique gimmicks
- Potentially a speedrun timer

**Gameplay**: There will be 3-5 levels overall. Each level is short but it loops when you beat it. Use precise platforming to break out of the loop.

**Game Engine**: Godot 4.4 

**Experience**: 7 game jams using Unity and Godot

**Other Notes**: This is for the GMTK 2025 game jam with the theme "loop". Probably gonna do 16x16 pixel art.

## Update post
**10-HOUR UPDATE - IDK yet**

**GitHub Repo**: https://github.com/Brooklyn-Dev/gmtk-2025

**Itch.io link**: N/A

**New Features**
- Responsive player movement with acceleration, friction and reduced air control
- Variable jump height, coyote time, jump buffering, jump hang time
- Wall jumps, wall sliding, limit fall speed
- Basic scene management and menu
- Player animations (idle, run, jump, fall, slide)
- Player trail (used for visualizing jump path, may or may not keep)

**Most challenging**: Nailing the player movement. It doesn't look that impressive, but you can feel the difference.

Next up: Environment tileset, levels, polish
